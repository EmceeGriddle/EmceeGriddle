- 👋 Hi, I’m @EmceeGriddle
- 👀 I’m interested in being less awful at my job, learning things that I probably won't be successful at, and making funny parody songs that no one will listen to.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how much I don't know about everything I've studied.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not a single thing. I likely bring no appreciable skills to what you're trying to accomplish.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Bears have unique nose prints.
